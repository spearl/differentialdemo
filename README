Final Project - Differential
Landon Spear (spearl@colorado.edu)
CSCI 5229 - Computer Graphics

Compile with 'make'
Run with './differential'

 *  Drive the differential using: 
 *              w
 *            a s d   b
 *
 *  'w' will accelerate the driveshaft
 *  's' will slow it down
 *  'b' hits the breaks
 *  'a' turns left and slows down the left wheel
 *  'd' turns right and slows down the right wheel
 *  
 *  You may turn left or right until the gear speed
 *  matches the driveshaft speed, at which point one of
 *  the wheels will be stationary and the other turning
 *  at twice normal speed. You can turn back the other way
 *  to balance out the wheels or simply accelerate to give
 *  that wheel an extra boost.
 *
 *  This project is indendended as an educational tool to
 *  simplify and explore a complex mechanical system that all modern
 *  cars employ. By playing with the left and right turns one can
 *  see how a car is able to compensate for different wheel speeds
 *  during cornering.
 *
 *  This was an incredibly fun project and I learned an enormous amount
 *  while completing it. If I had more time I would add more detail to the
 *  model by making the gear teeth more realistic by not making them square,
 *  adding more models in simpler but less aplicable set ups, and adding a model
 *  with a curved hypoid gear that is the actual model used in cars today.
 *
 *
 *  The following are standard options to change lighting
 *     features, turn of the axis, etc...
 *
 *  'p' to switch modes (projections)
 *  'x' to toggle axes
 *  '0' snaps angles to 0,0
 *  arrows to rotate the world
 *  PgUp/PgDn zooms in/out
 *  +/- changes field of view of perspective
 *  F1 toggles smooth/flat shading
 *  F2 toggles local viewer mode
 *  F3 toggles light distance (1/5)
 *  F8 change ball increment
 *  F9 invert bottom normal
 *  'l' toggles lighting
 *  a/A decrease/increase ambient light
 *  d/D decrease/increase diffuse light
 *  s/S decrease/increase specular light
 *  e/E decrease/increase emitted light
 *  n/N decrease/increase shininess
 *  m  toggles light movement
 *  [] lower/rise light
